Here, there are three implementations to solve TSp. 

First, one is the brute force algorithm. Using it is not recommended, as it is very slow.

Second one is the local search (branch and bound). It is faster than brute force but very slower than the next one Therefore using it is also not recommended.

The recommended is using dynamic programming implementation. It runs in much faster than others in the average case.

(Also, there is a tester file which can be used to verify the correctness of an algorithm for TSp by comparing results of that algorithm with the brute force results.)
