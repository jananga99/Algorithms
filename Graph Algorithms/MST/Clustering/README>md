Given 𝑛 points on a plane and an integer 𝑘, compute the largest possible value of 𝑑 such that the
given points can be partitioned into 𝑘 non-empty subsets in such a way that the distance between any
two points from different subsets is at least 𝑑.

Input Format. The first line contains the number 𝑛 of points. Each of the following 𝑛 lines defines a point
(𝑥𝑖 , 𝑦𝑖 ). The last line contains the number 𝑘 of clusters.

Constraints. 2 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 200; −103 ≤ 𝑥𝑖 , 𝑦𝑖 ≤ 103 are integers. All points are pairwise different.
